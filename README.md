# Morse Code Communicator using BASYS 3 FPGA

This project implements a Morse code communication system on the BASYS 3 FPGA development board. Morse code, historically used in telecommunication, encodes characters as sequences of dots and dashes (or "dits" and "dahs"). The BASYS 3 FPGA is leveraged to encode and decode text messages into Morse code signals and vice versa, enabling communication through light emitting diodes (LEDs) and speakers.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main modules implemented in VHDL:

1. **Input Module**: Responsible for accepting user input (text messages) and converting them into Morse code signals.
   
2. **Decoder Module**: Converts received Morse code signals back into text messages, allowing for bidirectional communication.

3. **Top Module**: Orchestrates the communication between the Input and Decoder modules, interfaces with the BASYS 3 FPGA peripherals (LEDs, switches, push buttons, and speaker), and manages overall system behavior.

## Features:
- **Morse Code Generation**: Convert text input into Morse code signals.
- **Signal Output**: Display Morse code signals using LEDs.
- **User Interface**: Simple interface for entering text messages and viewing Morse code outputs.
- **Real-Time Conversion**: Immediate conversion of text to Morse code and vice versa.

## Components:
- **BASYS 3 FPGA**: Xilinx FPGA board used for logic implementation.
- **VHDL Implementation**: Hardware Description Language used to define the system's behavior.
- **Push Buttons and Switches**: Interface for user input and control.
- **LEDs**: Display Morse code signals visually.
- **Speaker**: Output audio signals corresponding to Morse code.

## Usage:
1. **Input Text**: Enter text messages using the provided interface.
2. **Convert to Morse Code**: Automatically convert the entered text into Morse code.
3. **Output**: LEDs will display the Morse code signals.
4. **Decode Morse Code**: Optionally, decode received Morse code signals back into text.
